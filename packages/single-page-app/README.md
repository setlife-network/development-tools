# `single-page-app`

This tool will get you set up with a single-page web application running React. We'll use `create-react-app` to configure the foundation and then add some other layers in case you'd like a bit more structure to get started.

## Requirements

Node v6.1.0+

## Usage

1. In your terminal, move into a new directory and run `npx @setlife/single-page-app` to start setting up.

2. After the installation completes, you can run `npm start` and then go to `localhost:3000` in your browser to see the standard Create React App splash page and follow Facebook's guidance by clicking "Learn React" to start building your app.

We will be adding some more structure and guidance on exploring the directory structure of your new single page React application

## Potential Issues

1. `The program 'npm' is currently not installed.`

You need to install NodeJS and NPM on your machine. Do a Google search and use the Tools setting to change "Any time" to "Past Year" for the most up-to-date method of installing Node for your operating system.
